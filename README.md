## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Status

Due to time constraints, this submission focuses on delivering the **core layout and responsive structure** rather than full pixel-perfect accuracy.  
A few sections remain unfinished, and planned **scroll-based and hover animations** were not implemented yet.

With additional time, the next steps would include:

- Fine-tuning element positioning for pixel-level precision.
- Implementing smooth scroll-triggered animations.
- Completing the remaining visual sections and final polish as well as code refactoring to improve code cleaniness and standards.
